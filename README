This is a simple, verify-only C/C++ codebase for enabling client
applications to support TACK.  The ECDSA verification and hashing can be done with
either OpenSSL or NSS.

To compile the test "tackc" program use:

  make TACKC_OPENSSL=1 TACKC_CPP=1

(You can try TACKC_NSS=1 instead of TACKC_OPENSSL).

You may need to edit the Makefile to find your OpenSSL and NSS include
files and libraries.

Then run:

  ./tackc test

To see unit-testing results.
