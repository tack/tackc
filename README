This is a simple, verify-only C codebase for enabling client
applications to support TACK.  The ECDSA verification can be done with
either OpenSSL or NSS.

To compile the test "tackc" program use:

  make TACKC_OPENSSL=1 TACK_NSS=1

If you only want to test OpenSSL or NSS, then omit one of the variable
declarations.  You may need to edit the Makefile to find your OpenSSL
and NSS include files and libraries.

Then run:

  ./tackc test testoutdata/TACK.dat

To see if it can verify the binary TACK correctly.
